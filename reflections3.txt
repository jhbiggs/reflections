What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The copy of the last known state makes it possible to keep an original version if you need to go back to it, and to identify changes you made locally and without internet access.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when there is more than one collaborator, so we can share work.
